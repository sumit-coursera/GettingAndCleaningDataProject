## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The class project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) was to read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

This will download the data files if necessary.


**Steps to run the R script:**

1. Clone the repo
2. Open RStudio and set the working directory to the root of the project
3. Open run_analysis.R The script will download the data files if necessary .If you wan to avoid downloading the dataset, copy the data set into data/DataSet.zip
4. Run the script. The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [tidydata.txt](tidydata.txt).

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
